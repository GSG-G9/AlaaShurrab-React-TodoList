### Our journey to completion

### User story

- as a user i want to be able to add any mission or task to the list so that i can remember to do it later.
- as a user i want to click a button to reset the the list so that i can start over with a new list 
- as a user i want to click on the task to mark it done so that i remember that i have done it and i dont need to do it any more
- as a user i want to click abutton to remove an item from the list so that i can add another one insted 

### Stretch Goals

Adding more styling to the page :
- put every suggestion in drop down menu
allowing the user to create more lists without removing the original 
adding a database to save the data in casse of crach
adding a edit functin so that the user can just change the content of the task in sted of removing it and creating a new one
